Hugo extended edition is used for building a documentation website. In this example, Hugo is installed in *C:\hugo\bin*.

Install Hugo using a prebuilt binary archive:

1. Visit the [Hugo latest release](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/latest) page.
2. Scroll down to the **Assets** section.
3. Find and download the *hugo_extended* archive for your operating system and architecture (for example, *hugo_extended_0.111.3_windows-amd64.zip*).
4. Extract the archive.
5. Move the executable (*hugo.exe*) to your desired directory (for example, *C:\hugo\bin*)
6. Add this directory to the PATH environment variable.
7. Verify that you have execute permission on the file.

Consult your operating system documentation if you need help setting file permissions or modifying your PATH environment variable.

If you do not see a prebuilt binary for the desired edition, operating system, and architecture, install Hugo using a package manager, Docker, or Build from source. For instructions, see [Install Hugo on Windows](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/).
